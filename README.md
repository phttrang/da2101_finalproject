# Final Project: Netflix Movies and TV Shows
# Introduction
This project is conducted within the course DA2101 with the datasets on Kaggle.com including ../input/imdb-extensive-dataset and ../input/netflix-shows. I would like to visualize some simple and basic exploratory data analysis to understand Netflix dataset. In addition, I also try to predict how many movies and TV shows could be added in 2021 according to those past data from 2008 to 2020. 
# Lesson Learned
I have learned various new concepts through this course and the project. I have little background in statistics, data sciences, maths, programming or anything related. Thus, it is such a challenging but practical journey for me to follow very new things. I have acquired how data works and brings more insights for better decision-makings, not only in business. Through many other projects, I have seen how data has helped humans address issues in a variety of fields. I know that my project is not much extraordinary, but nothing could be excellent at the first try. I will practice and improve my skills more. 
# Further Analysis
If I have more time for this project, I would complete the tasks below:
* Try to develop a prediciton model for movie ratings with specific features, for example: genre, director, cast, studio, writer, budget...
* Try to visualize more interesting graphs and insights.
